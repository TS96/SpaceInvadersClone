# SpaceInvadersClone
This is a multi-platform game that was created using Java and libGDX framework. It runs on Android, IOS, desktop and web. The game is very
similar to Space Invaders but it does have some differences in terms of gameplay. Currently is %100 playable but I still have a lot of improvments
and ideas that I want to implement but haven't gotten to do so yet.
### TODOs
These are some of ideas that I'm going to implement very soon:
<ul>
<li>Set a certain number of lives to the player</li>
<li>Add something for the player to hide underneath until it gets destroyed by the enemies or the player</li>
<li>Include a top score somewhere on screen</li>
<li>Start the game with an intro screen that might include some info on the game or such</li>
<li>Might implement player-bullet/enemey-bullet collision which destroys both bullets</li>
